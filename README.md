# starterApp

The Angular Material Design starter project rewritten to make use of the Yeoman build tools. You could use this as a starting point for your own Angular Material Design project but have it built and ready for professional deployment.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.14.0.

## installation

Clone this repo
Run `npm install` which will install the Yeoman tools, yo, bower, grunt etc.

Run `bower install` to install packages for the starter application

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Issues

See notes.txt for resolutions to some installation issues that I had
