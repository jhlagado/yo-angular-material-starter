Issues with Yeoman installation

ISSUE:
Need the most recentâ€Œ install of Node & NPM


curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

ISSUE:
Install npm packages globally without sudo


edit .bashrc

NPM_PACKAGES="${HOME}/.npm-packages"
PATH="$NPM_PACKAGES/bin:$PATH"
export PATH

see: https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md

ISSUE:
globally install yeoman tools (including angular and karma generators) 


npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular

ISSUE: 
grunt build: Couldn't run imagemin 


Reverted imagemin to version 0.9
npm cache clean && npm install grunt-contrib-imagemin@0.9.1

OR: 

add the following to the devDependencies section of package.json
"grunt-contrib-imagemin": "1.0.0"
"vinyl-fs": "2.3.1"
remove node-modules (maybe just clear npm cache?)
npm install

ISSUE: 
grunt test: Couldn't run Karma with grunt test


Reinstalled Karma
npm install grunt-karma karma karma-phantomjs-launcher karma-jasmine jasmine-core phantomjs-prebuilt --save-dev

ISSUE:
Install modules with bower use: 
bower install --save <bower-package-name(s)>

To deploy with only a package.json and a bower.json
npm install
bower install 
bower update
grunt build

Update packages, use:
bower update

To update index.html to reflect these new bower modules run: grunt  

ISSUE:

Getting protractor running for end-to-end (e2e) testing

# Install protractor
npm install protractor --save-dev
 
# Download the selenium standalone server
./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update
